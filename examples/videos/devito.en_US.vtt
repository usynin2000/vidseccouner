00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.376
<b>Are these hard-boiled eggs?</b>

2
00:00:01.376 --> 00:00:03.211
<b>Oh, thank God.</b>

3
00:00:03.211 --> 00:00:04.462
<b>Hi, this is Danny DeVito, </b>
<b></b>

4
00:00:04.462 --> 00:00:05.714
<b>and this is how</b>
<b></b>
<b>you eat an egg, </b>

5
00:00:05.714 --> 00:00:08.133
<b>and still say your lines,</b>
<b>on Broadway —</b>

6
00:00:08.174 --> 00:00:09.968
<b>without choking.</b>

7
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:11.636
<b>That's not true.</b>

8
00:00:13.972 --> 00:00:16.141
<b>Solomon takes a</b>
<b>hard-boiled egg</b>

9
00:00:16.141 --> 00:00:18.893
<b>out of the portfolio </b>
<b>and cracks it on his knuckles.</b>

1
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.105
<b>I use my cane.</b>

1
00:00:22.147 --> 00:00:23.690
<b>It's kind of funny, I think.</b>

1
00:00:25.942 --> 00:00:27.986
<b>What's this now, lunch?</b>

1
00:00:27.986 --> 00:00:30.363
<b>You give me such an argument,</b>
<b>I got hungry.</b>

1
00:00:30.363 --> 00:00:32.991
<b>I'm not supposed to get </b>
<b>too hungry.</b>

1
00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:35.368
<b>We've had some difficult</b>
<b>nights,</b>

1
00:00:35.368 --> 00:00:36.786
<b>you know where the</b>
<b>peel doesn't come off.</b>

1
00:00:36.786 --> 00:00:38.496
<b>Some of the egg comes with it.</b>

1
00:00:38.538 --> 00:00:39.956
<b>I got a thumb movement</b>
<b></b>

1
00:00:39.956 --> 00:00:42.167
<b>and I've developed a this —</b>
<b>you know, this thing,</b>

2
00:00:42.167 --> 00:00:44.252
<b>kind of, like, "tadadit,</b>
<b>tadadit, tadadit."</b>

2
00:00:44.252 --> 00:00:45.295
<b>Aiming toward the bag,</b>

2
00:00:45.295 --> 00:00:46.421
<b>always aiming toward</b>
<b>the bag,</b>

2
00:00:46.421 --> 00:00:49.382
<b>because Solomon doesn't clean.</b>

2
00:00:49.382 --> 00:00:51.092
<b>That's the way it is.</b>

2
00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.187
<b>What, you want me </b>
<b>to starve to death?</b>

2
00:01:02.187 --> 00:01:05.106
<b>I try to, like, take a nice</b>
<b>hefty amount</b>

2
00:01:05.106 --> 00:01:07.150
<b>in the very beginning.</b>

2
00:01:07.192 --> 00:01:09.778
<b>It's really good to dig into</b>
<b>the yellow,</b>

2
00:01:09.778 --> 00:01:11.946
<b>because that's where</b>
<b>the kind of</b>

3
00:01:11.946 --> 00:01:14.616
<b>masticating conflict is.</b>

3
00:01:14.616 --> 00:01:16.493
<b>I'll be very quick here.</b>

3
00:01:16.534 --> 00:01:18.036
<b>I'm going to give you a good</b>
<b>price.</b>

3
00:01:18.036 --> 00:01:19.454
<b>Don't worry.</b>

3
00:01:19.454 --> 00:01:22.415
<b>I'm gonna knock you off your</b>
<b>feet with the price.</b>

3
00:01:22.415 --> 00:01:25.835
<b>It is very difficult to eat </b>
<b>just a dry, hard-boiled egg.</b>

3
00:01:25.835 --> 00:01:27.754
<b>So, you know, it really </b>
<b>motivates,</b>

3
00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:29.172
<b>if you get enough in there,</b>

3
00:01:29.172 --> 00:01:31.674
<b>it motivates the next line,</b>
<b>which is:</b>

3
00:01:31.674 --> 00:01:35.637
<b>There wouldn't be a little</b>
<b>salt, I suppose?</b>

4
00:01:35.637 --> 00:01:38.431
<b>Because you really would like</b>
<b>a little salt.</b>

4
00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:40.558
<b>You need some saliva,</b>
<b>you know.</b>

4
00:01:40.558 --> 00:01:43.853
<b>I mean, right now I'm spitting</b>
<b>all over the place.</b>

4
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.732
<b>Don't chew with your mouth</b>
<b>full!</b>

4
00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:50.527
<b>Why? It's funny.</b>

4
00:01:50.527 --> 00:01:53.238
<b>I'm not going running for salt</b>
<b>now.</b>

4
00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:54.531
<b>Don't be blue.</b>

4
00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:57.033
<b>I'm going to knock you off your</b>
<b>feet with the price.</b>

4
00:01:57.033 --> 00:01:58.409
<b>You'll see.</b>

4
00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:00.870
<b>It's fun every night.</b>

5
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.122
<b>It's different every night. </b>

5
00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:03.414
<b>When you're up there,</b>
<b>it's like skiing.</b>

5
00:02:03.414 --> 00:02:04.874
<b>It's like you're going</b>
<b>down the mountain.</b>

5
00:02:04.874 --> 00:02:06.876
<b>Yeah there's rocks and things,</b>
<b>and things happen —</b>

5
00:02:06.876 --> 00:02:08.253
<b>all kinds of stuff.</b>

5
00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:09.504
<b>The audience gets into it</b>

5
00:02:09.504 --> 00:02:11.339
<b>and we do stretch it out</b>
<b>a little bit.</b>

5
00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:13.091
<b>It's very difficult for me</b>
<b>to go on stage</b>

5
00:02:13.091 --> 00:02:16.094
<b>and have — just eat the egg</b>
<b>and, like, let it go.</b>

5
00:02:16.094 --> 00:02:18.346
<b>Not to stop the play, not to</b>
<b>stop the play,</b>

6
00:02:18.346 --> 00:02:20.014
<b>because the play</b>
<b>is like the thing, so —</b>

6
00:02:20.014 --> 00:02:21.724
<b>But the idea is that</b>
<b>you gotta —</b>

6
00:02:21.724 --> 00:02:23.268
<b>you have a little fun</b>
<b>in the middle.</b>
